Primeira Parte:

      C#m7                F#m7
The club isn't the best place 

To find a lover
        A              B
So the bar is where I go
 C#m7
Me and my friends
        F#m7
At the table doing shots
          A                      B
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

     C#m7                       F#m7
Come over and start up a conversation
 
With just me
      A                        B
And trust me, I'll give it a chance
             C#m7
Now take my hand, stop
             F#m7
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
      A               B
And then we start to dance

And now I'm singing like

Pré-efrão:

 C#m7             F#m7
Girl, you know I want your love
 A
Your love was handmade 
 B                 C#m7
For somebody like me
              F#m7
Come on now, follow my lead
A                B
I may be crazy, don't mind me

      C#m7           F#m7
Say: Boy, let's not talk too much
 A
Grab on my waist 
     B                C#m7
And put that body on me
              F#m7
Come on now, follow my lead
       A                      B
Come, come on now, follow my lead

Refrão:

C#m7         F#m7                   A
     I'm in love with the shape of you
             B                  C#m7
We push and pull like a magnet do
             F#m7             A
Although my heart is falling too
        B                C#m7
I'm in love with your body

          F#m7                 A
And last night you were in my room
            B                    C#m7
And now my bedsheets smell like you
                  F#m7
Every day discovering 
                 A
Something brand new
        B                C#m7
I'm in love with your body

            F#m7
Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
A         B

            A                 B
We're going out on our first date
         C#m7

      F#m7
So go all you can eat
              A                    B
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

             C#m7
We talk for hours and hours
            F#m7
About the sweet and the sour
              A                B
And how your family is doing okay
           C#m7
Leave and get in a taxi
      F#m7
Then kiss in the backseat
           A                     B
Tell the driver make the radio play

And I'm singing like
